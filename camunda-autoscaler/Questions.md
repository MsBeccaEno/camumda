* How long did it take you to solve the exercise? (Please be honest, we evaluate your answer to this question based on your experience.)

`about six to seven days 3-4 hours per day.
When I started I was confident this task was about HPA, I pass it and
wanted to send, but read the task again, I decided that what may be required could be a
kind of operator pod and so I created one more variant`

* Which additional steps would you take in order to make this code production ready? Why?

`For default variant
metrics for monitoring,
bla bla,
bla bla`

`For hpa variant it is ready to production (at lease beta)`

* Which step took most of the time? Why?

`Find out how works your chalenge task`

`Read hpa docs for v2beta2 with polices rules`

The reason it took so long is because I had to fix alot of bugs in the process.
